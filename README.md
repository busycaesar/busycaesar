- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dev Shah, a student of Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing an Advanced Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis.

As a first-semester student, I am learning the C language which is helping me to build logical thinking and problem-solving abilities with the help of a new challenging workshop every week. We are expected to code a program that works exactly the same as specified in the workshop. Due to this, even I am developing the habit of paying attention to small things. Moreover, I am learning Unix/Linux due to which I am being exposed to working with CLI and learning its various commands. Apart from both of these subjects, I am also being taught Problem Solving and Computer Principles.
